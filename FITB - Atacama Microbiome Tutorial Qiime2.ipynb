Generate a tree for phylogenetic diversity analyses\nIn addition to counts of features per sample (i.e., the data in the `FeatureTable[Frequency]` Qiime2 artifact), some biodiversity metrics require a rooted phylogeentic tree relating the features to one another. These phylogenetic diveresity metrics include Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity and weighted and unweighted UniFrac. Phylogenetic trees in Qiime2 are stored as a `Phylogeny[Rooted]` Qiime2 artifact. We will use the `align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree` pipeline from the `q2-phylogeny` plugin. \n\nFirst, the pipeline uses the mafft program to perform a multiple sequence alignment of the sequences in our `FeatureData[Sequence]` to create a `FeatureData[AlignedSequence]` QIIME 2 artifact. Next, the pipeline masks (or filters) the alignment to remove positions that are highly variable. These positions are generally considered to add noise to a resulting phylogenetic tree. Following that, the pipeline applies FastTree to generate a phylogenetic tree from the masked alignment. The FastTree program creates an unrooted tree, so in the final step in this section, midpoint rooting is applied to place the root of the tree at the midpoint of the longest tip-to-tip distance in the unrooted tree.\n\nReplace `[INPUT]` with our input file name, which is `rep-seqs.qza` "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree \\\n  --i-sequences [INPUT] \\\n  --o-alignment aligned-rep-seqs.qza \\\n  --o-masked-alignment masked-aligned-rep-seqs.qza \\\n  --o-tree unrooted-tree.qza \\\n  --o-rooted-tree rooted-tree.qza","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. Alpha and beta diversity analysis\nQIIME2 offers diversity analyses through the `q2-diversity` plugin, which supports computing alpha and beta diversity metrics, applying related statistical tests, and generating interactive visualizations. We will first use the `core-metrics-phylogenetic method`, which rarefies a `FeatureTable[Frequency]` to a user-specified depth,  computes several alpha and beta diversity metrics, and generates principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots using Emperor for each of the beta diversity metrics. The metrics computed by default are:\n\nAlpha diversity\n\n   - Shannon’s diversity index (a quantitative measure of community richness)\n   - Observed Features (a qualitative measure of community richness)\n   - Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (a qualitiative measure of community richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n   - Evenness (or Pielou’s Evenness; a measure of community evenness)\n\nBeta diversity\n\n   - Jaccard distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity)\n   - Bray-Curtis distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity)\n   - unweighted UniFrac distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n   - weighted UniFrac distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n\nAn important parameter that needs to be provided to this script is `--p-sampling-depth`, which is the even sampling (i.e. rarefaction) depth. Because most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if you provide `--p-sampling-depth 500`, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky. We recommend making your choice by reviewing the information presented in the table.qzv file that was created above. Choose a value that is as high as possible (so you retain more sequences per sample) while excluding as few samples as possible.\n\nLooking at the `table.qzv` Qiime2 artifact we just generated, in particular the `'Interative Sample Detail'` tab in that visualization, what value would you choose to pass for `--p-sampling-depth`? How many samples will be excluded from your analysis based on this choice? How many total sequences will you be analyzing in the core-metrics-phylogenetic command?\n\nWe are also going to filter out a site that had missing metadata measurements for convenience of downstream beta diversity analyses.

You want to strike a balance between total seqeuences analyzed and number of samples retained. \n\nOn an Illumina run, it is common to see a few samples with very low sequence counts. These should typically be removed from analyses by setting a larger value for the sampling depth at this stage.\n\nAfter computing diversity metrics, we can begin to explore the microbiome community composition of samples in the context of sample metadata.
