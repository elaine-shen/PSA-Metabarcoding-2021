    "In addition to counts of features per sample (i.e., the data in the FeatureTable[Frequency] Qiime2 artifact), some biodiversity metrics require a rooted phylogeentic tree relating the features to one another. These phylogenetic diveresity metrics include Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity and weighted and unweighted UniFrac. Phylogenetic trees in Qiime2 are stored as a Phylogeny[Rooted] Qiime2 artifact. We will use the align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree pipeline from the q2-phylogeny plugin. \n",

    "First, the pipeline uses the mafft program to perform a multiple sequence alignment of the sequences in our FeatureData[Sequence] to create a FeatureData[AlignedSequence] QIIME 2 artifact. Next, the pipeline masks (or filters) the alignment to remove positions that are highly variable. These positions are generally considered to add noise to a resulting phylogenetic tree. Following that, the pipeline applies FastTree to generate a phylogenetic tree from the masked alignment. The FastTree program creates an unrooted tree, so in the final step in this section midpoint rooting is applied to place the root of the tree at the midpoint of the longest tip-to-tip distance in the unrooted tree."

    "## 4. Alpha and beta diversity analysis\n",
    "QIIME2 offers diversity analyses through the q2-diversity plugin, which supports computing alpha and beta diversity metrics, applying related statistical tests, and generating interactive visualizations. We will first use the core-metrics-phylogenetic method, which rarefies a FeatureTable[Frequency] to a user-specified depth,  computes several alpha and beta diversity metrics, and generates principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots using Emperor for each of the beta diversity metrics. The metrics computed by default are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Shannon’s diversity index (a quantitative measure of community richness)\n",
    "   - Observed Features (a qualitative measure of community richness)\n",
    "   - Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (a qualitiative measure of community richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n",
    "   - Evenness (or Pielou’s Evenness; a measure of community evenness)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beta diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Jaccard distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity)\n",
    "   - Bray-Curtis distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity)\n",
    "   - unweighted UniFrac distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n",
    "   - weighted UniFrac distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter that needs to be provided to this script is --p-sampling-depth, which is the even sampling (i.e. rarefaction) depth. Because most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if you provide --p-sampling-depth 500, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky. We recommend making your choice by reviewing the information presented in the table.qzv file that was created above. Choose a value that is as high as possible (so you retain more sequences per sample) while excluding as few samples as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the table.qzv Qiime2 artifact we just generated, in particular the 'Interative Sample Detail' tab in that visualization, what value would you choose to pass for --p-sampling-depth? How many samples will be excluded from your analysis based on this choice? How many total sequences will you be analyzing in the core-metrics-phylogenetic command?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to filter out a site that had missing metadata measurements for convenience of downstream beta diversity analyses. We will then use `table-filtered.qza` for the remaining analyses."

    " Next, we will analyze the sample composition in the contet of categorical metadata using PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2001) using the `beta-group-significance` command. The commands will test whether distances between samples within a group are more similar to each other than they are to samples from the other groups. PERMANOVA can also perform pairwise tests that allow you to determine which specific pairs of groups differ from one another. We will do this here with `--p-pairwise`. This command can be slow to run since it's based on permutation test. We will run `beta-group-significance` on specific metadata columns to reduce computation time. Here, will apply this to our unweighted UniFrac distances, using two sample metadata columns, as follows:"

    "Finally, ordination is a popular approach for exploring microbiome community composition in the context of sample metadata. We can use the Emperor tool to explore principal coordinates (PCoA) plots in the context of sample metadata. While our `core-metrics-phylogenetic` command did already generate some Emperor plots, we want to pass an optional parameter, `--p-custom-axes`, which is very useful for exploring our data. The PCoA results that were used in `core-metrics-phylogeny` are also available, making it easy to generate new visualizations with Emperor. We will generate Emperor plots for unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis so that the resulting plot will contain axes for principal coordinate 1, principal coordinate 2, and vegetation start. We will use that last axis to explore how these samples changed across sites based on the environmental variable \"average-soil-temperature\". "
